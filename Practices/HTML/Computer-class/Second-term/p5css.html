                ENIAC(<span class="orange">Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer</span>) was the first <span class="yellow">programmable</span>, electronic,
                general-purpose digital computer made in 1945.
                It was Turing-complete and able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate
                artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory
                (<span class="orange">which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory</span>), its first program was
                a study of the feasibility of the <span class="yellow">thermonuclear</span> weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="pink">ENIAC</span> was formally dedicated at the <span class="pink">University of Pennsylvania</span> on February 15, 1946, having cost almost $500,000
                (<span class="orange">approximately equivalent to $7,283,000 in 2020</span>), and was heralded as a "Giant Brain" by the press. It had a speed
                on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines; this computational power,
                coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists alike. The combination of speed
                and <span class="yellow">programmability</span> allowed for thousands more calculations for problems, as ENIAC calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds
                that took a human 20 hours (<span class="orange">allowing one ENIAC to displace 2,400 humans</span>).
