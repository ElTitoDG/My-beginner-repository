		<h1>Exploration of the Moon</h1>
		<p>
			The physical <b>exploration of the Moon</b> began when <i>Luna 2</i>, a space probe launched by the Soviet Union, made an impact on the surface of the Moon on September 14, 1959. 
			Prior to that the only available means of exploration had been observation from Earth. The invention of the optical telescope brought about the first leap in the quality of lunar
			observations. <i>Galileo Galilei</i> is generally credited as the first person to use a telescope for astronomical purposes; 
			having made his own telescope in 1609, the mountains and craters on the lunar surface were among his first observations using it.

			<b>NASA</b>'s Apollo program was the only program to successfully land humans on the Moon, which it did six times. The first landing took 
			place in 1969, when two Apollo 11 astronauts placed scientific instruments and returned lunar samples to Earth.

		<h2>Before spaceflight</h2>
		<p>
			The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former. 
			His non-religious view of the heavens was one cause for his imprisonment and eventual exile. In his book <i>On the Face in the Moon's Orb</i>, Plutarch suggested that the Moon 
			had deep recesses in which the light of the Sun did not reach and that the spots are nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms. He also entertained the possibility that the Moon was inhabited. Aristarchus
			went a step further and computed the distance from Earth, together with its size, obtaining a value of 20 times the Earth radius for the distance (the real value is 60; the Earth radius was roughly known since Eratosthenes)
